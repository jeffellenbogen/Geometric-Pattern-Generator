# Geometric-Pattern-Generator

This is an exploration in creating a website that allows a user to control parameters that render on the canvas in the browser to create exportable SVG files for the ultimate purpose of plotting on a pen plotter.
Explorations have included coding via prompting in Claude, Gemini, and eventually Cursor.

Variations so far include...
**Geometric Pattern Generator (Mandalas made of shapes)
Wave pattern Generator (Sine, Cosine, Square Wave, etc.)
Planetary position of our solar system**
