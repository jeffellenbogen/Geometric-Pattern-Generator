# Geometric-Pattern-Generator

This is an exploration in creating a website that allows a user to control parameters that render on the canvas in the browser to create exportable SVG files for the ultimate purpose of plotting on a pen plotter.
Explorations have included coding via prompting in Claude, Gemini, and eventually Cursor.

These were developed as part of my explorations for #PlotParty for September 2025

Variations so far include...</br>
